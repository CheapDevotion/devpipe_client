Basic Setup
-----------
Be sure to change the ip address in index.html to match that of you development machine. The node server and html form for sending data to the server are both located in the test_server folder. 

The client code (index.html) can be opened on a Desktop, iPad, or iPhone, and the UI should adjust accordingly.

There will probably be more useful information in this file later, specifically dealing with new features and what needs to be tested.
